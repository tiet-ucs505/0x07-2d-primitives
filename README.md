# 0x07 : Composing 2D Primitives with Transformations #

## Objective ##

+ Use
  [Path2D](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Path2D)
  to define primitives.
+ Define geometric transforms and apply, including
  + Rigid-body tranforms
  + Reflection
  + Shear
+ Modify render properties, *e.g.*
  + Stroke outline with Line type, Line width, and
    Color/Gradient/Pattern
  + Fill Region with Color/Gradient/Pattern
  
## Lab Exercise ##

Available on branch `example`.

## Assignment ##

1. Choose a shape at random.
2. Approximate it using explicit draw functions.
3. Enable the transformer interface, and listen for its
   signals on the `console`.
4. Add event listeners on transformer to update the
   drawing on canvas respectively.
